# Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is a simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch application that allows users to draw on a grid by interacting with squares using their mouse.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- **index.html**: This file defines the structure of the web page, including the grid area, buttons, and slider for adjusting grid size.

- **script.js**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for creating the grid, handling user interactions, and implementing various drawing modes (Clear, Shade, Random, Eraser).

- **styles.css**: The CSS file provides basic styling for the webpage, defining the layout and appearance of the grid, buttons, and slider.

## Getting Started

To use the Etch-a-Sketch application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The grid will be displayed, and you can start drawing by interacting with the squares.

## Features

- **Grid Size Slider**: Adjust the size of the grid using the slider at the bottom of the page.
  
- **Clear Button**: Clear the entire grid to white by clicking the "Clear" button.

- **Shade Button**: Progressively darken the squares with each interaction. The objective is to achieve a completely black square after ten interactions.

- **Random Button**: Color each square with a random color when the mouse is pressed and dragged.

- **Eraser Button**: Turn on the eraser mode to set the background color of squares to white.

## Usage

1. **Drawing Modes**: Toggle between drawing modes by clicking on the respective buttons (Clear, Shade, Random, Eraser).

2. **Adjust Grid Size**: Use the slider to change the size of the grid.

3. **Draw on the Grid**: Interact with the squares in the grid area to draw based on the selected mode.

## Styling

The styling is kept minimal to focus on functionality. Feel free to customize the styles in the `styles.css` file to suit your preferences.
